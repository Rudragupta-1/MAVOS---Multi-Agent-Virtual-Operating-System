# MAVOS - Multi-Aspect Virtual Operating System

## 📌 Introduction
MAVOS (**Multi-Aspect Virtual Operating System**) is an advanced **OS simulation and research environment** designed to provide deep insights into core Computer Science concepts, including **process scheduling, memory management, file systems, networking, concurrency, and security**. It enables users to create, manipulate, and monitor processes while experimenting with different OS functionalities in a **controlled virtual environment**.

Unlike traditional operating system simulators, MAVOS integrates **AI-driven optimizations, real-time monitoring dashboards, fault tolerance mechanisms, and security implementations**, making it a powerful tool for **students, researchers, and developers** to understand how real-world operating systems function.

---

## 📜 Project Structure
MAVOS is structured into multiple modules, each handling a crucial OS concept:

1. **Process Management** (CPU Scheduling & Multi-threading)
2. **Memory Management** (Allocation, Paging, Segmentation)
3. **File System Simulation** (File I/O, Directory Management)
4. **Networking & Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
5. **Thread Synchronization & Deadlock Prevention**
6. **Fault Tolerance & System Recovery**
7. **Security & Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
8. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**
9. **AI-Driven Resource Optimization**
10. **System Load Testing & Benchmarking**

Each module operates independently yet interacts to **simulate a fully functioning OS-like environment.**

## 🛠 Features
### ✅ **Core OS Functionalities**
- **Process Creation & Management:** Users can create, run, and terminate processes while selecting scheduling algorithms like **FCFS, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First (SJF)**.
- **Threading & Synchronization:** Implements **mutexes, semaphores, and monitors** to handle concurrency and avoid race conditions.
- **Memory Allocation:** Simulates **contiguous allocation, paging, and segmentation** with a **real-time memory visualizer**.
- **Virtual File System (VFS):** Supports **file creation, reading, writing, and deletion**, allowing hierarchical directory structures.
- **Networking & IPC:** Enables **socket-based inter-process communication (client-server model)**.
- **Deadlock Detection & Recovery:** Implements **Banker’s Algorithm and Resource Allocation Graphs (RAGs)**.

### 🚀 **Advanced Functionalities**
- **Fault Tolerance & Checkpointing:** Saves process states and restores them in case of failures.
- **AI-Driven Performance Optimization:** Uses **machine learning models** to predict and optimize CPU & memory usage dynamically.
- **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:** A **GUI-based** dashboard displaying process states, memory usage, and CPU load.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Implements **multi-user access management with permissions** to ensure security.
- **System Load Testing & Benchmarking:** Allows users to simulate **high CPU & memory loads**, analyzing system performance under stress.

## 🔥 Uniqueness of MAVOS
MAVOS is **not just another OS simulator**; it stands out because:
1. **Combines multiple CS domains (OS, Networking, AI, Security) into one project.**
2. **AI-driven resource management** to optimize scheduling and memory allocation.
3. **Real-time graphical monitoring dashboard** for system analysis.
4. **Fault tolerance mechanisms** ensuring system stability during failures.
5. **Security through RBAC**, ensuring controlled access to system operations.
6. **Supports dynamic experimentation**, allowing users to test multiple configurations and load scenarios.

Unlike generic OS simulators available on **GitHub or YouTube**, MAVOS is designed for **deep system-level learning, benchmarking, and research applications.**
